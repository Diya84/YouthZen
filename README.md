## About The Project
Our initiative is a platform that offers young people mental health support. We provide a variety of materials, such as articles, videos, and access to online counselling and therapy services, all of which are intended to assist young people in managing their mental health and wellbeing. Also, a community forum is a feature of our platform where users may interact with one another, connect with peers, and support one another in a private and secure environment. We aim to make mental health support more accessible and less stigmatised for young people, so that they can live happier and healthier lives.
